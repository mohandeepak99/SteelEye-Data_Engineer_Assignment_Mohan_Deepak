The repo contains main.py file 

For all the operations like 
-->listing the trade 
-->finding the trade by id 
-->searching trades
-->Advanced Filtering 

The API has been created using FASTapi and mock dataset is taken to verify the results.

Used Uvicorn to run the API after you install all the dependencies
the first command is : "pip install fastapi uvicorn"
the second command is to run the API using uvicorn that is : "uvicorn main:app --reload"
--> Here things to note are the name of the application is main and the FASTAPI instance is app so that is how the naming convention is derived.

For better understanding let's take name of the python file as hello then command will be "uvicorn hello:app --reload"

Now you haven't any errors then move to the "http://localhost:8000"
You will get a welcome message there and from here you can get the response for different requests.
